## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my complete coursework and practical notebooks for the **“Python for Data Science”** program offered by **Infosys Springboard** through my university during the 3rd semester of my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering**.

The goal of this repository is twofold:

1. To serve as a **learning log** documenting my progress through core Data Science libraries which include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

2. To present a **professional portfolio reference** for recruiters and collaborators demonstrating my structured, hands-on understanding of Python’s data stack.

All work has been completed using **Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.13.3)** with datasets and exercises provided by the course itself.

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Vishwajit1610/data-science-with-python.git
cd data-science-with-python
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

```text
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
```

Then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any `.ipynb` file from the desired module folder.

## 🧩 Modules Overview

### 🧮 NumPy

Covers array creation, matrix operations, linear algebra, indexing, and real-world image handling using NumPy as the foundation of scientific computing.

### 🗂️ Pandas

Focuses on DataFrame creation, cleaning, reshaping, grouping, and pivot tables and all essential for data manipulation and preprocessing.

### 📊 Matplotlib

Introduces bar charts, pie charts, multiple graphs, and real-world visualization examples for understanding data presentation.

(Datasets like FIFA and Pokémon were provided by the course to demonstrate visualization and manipulation techniques.)
