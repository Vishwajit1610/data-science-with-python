## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my complete coursework and practical notebooks for the **“Python for Data Science”** program offered by **Infosys Springboard** through my university during the 3rd semester of **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering**.

The goal of this repository is twofold:

1. To serve as a **learning log** documenting my progress through Python’s data science ecosystem such as  NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
    
2. To act as a **professional portfolio reference**, demonstrating structured, hands-on mastery of data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning fundamentals.
    

All work has been executed in **Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.13.3)** using curated course datasets and exercises.

## ⚙️ Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Vishwajit1610/data-science-with-python.git
cd data-science-with-python
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:

```text
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

Then install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any `.ipynb` file from the desired module folder.
